<h1 align="center">Welcome to <strong>Kurtz Tutoring</strong>.</h1>

<p align="center">My name is Josh Kurtz, and I graduated from the University of Michigan in May 2014 with a degree in Honors Biochemistry. As an undergraduate, I taught and tutored hundreds of students in a wide variety of introductory science courses at the University of Michigan. Post-graduation, I have continued to tutor full-time in addition to teaching for the School of Nursing. I believe that all of the students I work with are exceptionally intelligent, but often lecture-based learning does not fit their personal learning style. I love working with students to bridge this learning gap, helping them to genuinely understand course content and master homework and exams.</p>
